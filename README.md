# Health-Insurance-Data-Visualization-and-Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing health insurance data to uncover key insights into factors influencing insurance charges. Using statistical modeling and machine learning techniques, we explore correlations between various demographic and health-related attributes and insurance costs.

# Dataset Description
This health insurance dataset provides a comprehensive overview of individuals' demographic and 
health-related attributes, coupled with corresponding insurance charges. The dataset encompasses 
information on a diverse set of individuals, including details such as age, sex, body mass index (BMI), 
number of children, smoking habits, region of residence, and the associated insurance charges. It 
provides a real-world glimpse into how factors such as age, lifestyle choices, and geographical location 
impact the cost of health insurance coverage. The inclusion of diverse variables allows for a nuanced 
analysis, offering insights that can be applicable to both individual policyholders and the broader health 
insurance industry. 

# Research Questions:
My interest in exploring this dataset is fuelled by the practical relevance it holds for us as students at GMU. Notably, we have observed a substantial increase of $700 in our insurance expenses compared to the previous semester. Motivated by this real-world impact on our finances, we aim to conduct a detailed analysis of various factors influencing insurance policies. Through this examination, we hope to uncover insights that not only address our immediate concerns but also contribute valuable knowledge to the broader discourse on the determinants of insurance costs. 
- How does insurance charges vary with respect to BMI, and number of children? 
- Is there a significant difference in insurance charges between smokers and non-smokers? 
- How does insurance charges vary across different regions? 
- Which is the best fitting model for our dataset? Which variables are the most impactful on the 
insurance charges?

# Results
Key findings from the analysis include:
- The smoking attribute significantly increases insurance charges.
- BMI and age also have a notable impact.
- The random forest model performs better in capturing non-linear relationships.
